# Skycam

*This project is not currently being developed, but does accept pull requests.*

A skycam is a camera hung from four cables at the top corners of a box.  You may have seen one in a stadium, filming above the players on the field.

This model is built using two Arduino UNOs with Adafruit Motor shields.

A better method would be to use 3D printer hardware, Marlin 3D printer firmware, and a simulation like [Robot Overlord](https://github.com/MarginallyClever/robot-overlord-app).
